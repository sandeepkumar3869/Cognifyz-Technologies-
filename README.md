**Internship Project Description: Cognifyz Data Science Internship**

**Project Title:** Data Analysis and Feature Engineering for Restaurant Dataset

**Project Overview:**
During my internship at Cognifyz, I worked on a comprehensive data analysis project focusing on a dataset related to restaurants. The objective was to extract valuable insights from the data, perform preprocessing, conduct descriptive and geospatial analysis, and engage in feature engineering to enrich the dataset for further analysis and modeling.

**Tasks Completed:**https://github.com/sandeepkumar3869/Cognifyz-Technologies-

**1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing:**
- Explored the dataset to identify its dimensions.
- Detected and handled missing values in columns appropriately.
- Conducted data type conversion where necessary.
- Analyzed the distribution of the target variable, "Aggregate rating," and addressed any class imbalances.

**2. Descriptive Analysis:**
- Calculated basic statistical measures like mean, median, and standard deviation for numerical columns.
- Explored the distribution of categorical variables such as "Country Code," "City," and "Cuisines."
- Identified the top cuisines and cities with the highest number of restaurants.

**3. Geospatial Analysis:**
- Visualized restaurant locations on a map using latitude and longitude information.
- Analyzed the distribution of restaurants across different cities or countries.
- Explored correlations between the restaurant's location and its rating.

**4. Table Booking and Online Delivery Analysis:**
- Determined the percentage of restaurants offering table booking and online delivery services.
- Compared average ratings of restaurants with and without table booking.
- Analyzed the availability of online delivery across restaurants with different price ranges.

**5. Price Range Analysis:**
- Determined the most common price range among all restaurants.
- Calculated the average rating for each price range.
- Identified the color representing the highest average rating among different price ranges.

**6. Feature Engineering:**
- Extracted additional features from existing columns, such as the length of restaurant names or addresses.
- Created new features like "Has Table Booking" or "Has Online Delivery" by encoding categorical variables.

**Conclusion:**
Through the completion of these tasks, I gained valuable experience in data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, geospatial analysis, and feature engineering. This project not only enhanced my skills in data manipulation and visualization but also provided insights into the factors influencing restaurant ratings and services offered. The outcomes of this internship project contribute to the broader goal of leveraging data intelligence in the food and hospitality industry.
